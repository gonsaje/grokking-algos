# Divide & Conquer

Suppose you're a farmer with a plot of land.
You want to divide this farm evenly into square plots.
You want the plots to be as big as possible. 

How do you figure out the largest square size you can use a plot of land?
D&C algos are recursive algos.
To solve a problem using D&C, there are 2 steps:
+ Figure out the base cas. This should be the simplest possible case.
+ Divide or decrease your problem until it becomes the base case.
