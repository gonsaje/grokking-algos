Imagine a square piece of paper.
You're tasked with drawing 16 cubes on the paper
You can either draw each cub one by one
or you can fold the paper in half to create boxes in half the time

Big O establishes a worst-case run time

Common run times:
| Common runtimes |    Name   |    Example    |
|-----------------|:---------:|:-------------:|
|    O(log n)     | Log | Binary Search |
|      O(n)       |Linear| Simple Search |
|   O(n * log n)  |Quasi-Linear|  Quick Sort   |
|     O(n^2)      | N-Squared |  Select Sort  |
|      O(n!)      | Factorial |Traveling Salesperson|



Algorithms are not measured by runtime, but number of operations 

Exercises:

### 1.3

### 1.4
You have a phone number and want to find a person's name in the phone book
(Hint: You'll have to search thru the whole book!)

O(n)

### 1.5
You want to read numbers of every person in the phonebook

O(n)

### 1.6
